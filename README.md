# utmlinuxfs

This project is inspired by the amazing [anylinuxfs](https://github.com/nohajc/anylinuxfs),  
but since anylinuxfs has a limitation (only one drive can be mounted at a time, file owner and permissions issue 777),  
I tried to come up with a workaround to enable mounting multiple drives/disks simultaneously inside UTM.

# A Humble Disclaimer

Honestly, this project is still pretty rough and far from perfect.  
It might be bad compared to anylinuxfs or other solutions out there.  
Iâ€™m just an amateur tinkering around and sharing what I made in case it helps someone.

Please consider this a work in progress and use at your own risk.

# Issues
### USB Limitation with UTM
Since **UTM does not yet support USB 3.2**, you have two options:

- Use **USB 3.1** instead.  
  *(In my case, I only have a USB 3.1 hub with a Type-A plug, so I had to connect the enclosure to a USB 3.1 hub (Type-A), then into a USB 3.2 hub (Type-C), and finally to my MacBook Air.)*

- Or use **USB 2.0**,  
  but the transfer speed will be much slower.

# Requirements

- macOS running on Apple Silicon with **sudo** privileges  
- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app)  
- [Arch Linux ARM](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/archlinux-arm) image 
- stable internet 

## inside UTM

- Network: Use normal **Shared Network** with **virtio-net-pci** driver

## inside Arch Linux VM

### Initial setup

1. Install NFS server:
    ```
    pacman -S nfs-utils
    ```

2. Enable and start NFS server:
    ```
    systemctl enable nfs-server
    systemctl start nfs-server
    ````

3. Get the bash scripts from [`bash/`](bash/) directory to your Arch Linux VM and make them executable:
    ```
    chmod +x ./mountdisk.sh ./umountdisk.sh
    ```

# Mounting drives

When running Linux in the UTM window, there will be a **USB menu at the top right**.  
Use this menu to attach USB drives to Linux.

Then run the mount script:
```
./mountdisk.sh
```
You will see output similar to this:
```
[root@alarm ~]# ./mountdisk.sh 
Using Mac IP: 192.168.<MAC IP>
Using UTM (Linux) IP: 192.168.<UTM IP>
Skipping /dev/sda1 because label starts with EFI
Skipping /dev/sda2 of type 'swap'
Mounting /dev/sda3 at /mnt/<UUID>
Bind-mounting /mnt/<UUID> to /exported_mnt/<UUID>
Adding export for /exported_mnt/<UUID>

To mount from macOS, run:
  sudo mkdir -p /Volumes/<UUID>
  sudo mount -t nfs -o resvport,nolock 192.168.<UTM IP>:/exported_mnt/<UUID> /Volumes/<UUID>

Mounting /dev/sda4 at /mnt/<UUID>
Bind-mounting /mnt/<UUID> to /exported_mnt/<UUID>
Adding export for /exported_mnt/<UUID>

To mount from macOS, run:
  sudo mkdir -p /Volumes/<UUID>
  sudo mount -t nfs -o resvport,nolock 192.168.<UTM IP>:/exported_mnt/<UUID> /Volumes/<UUID>
````
This exports the drive over NFS from Linux. On macOS, mount it using the commands shown.

### Accessing the Mounted Drives on macOS
1. In Finder sidebar under **Network**, click your UTM VM's IP.
2. Browse the shared folders (named by UUID) exported via NFS.
3. Access files as usual.

## Unmounting drives
To unmount, run:
```
./umountdisk.sh
```
which performs the reverse operation.
